export const aboutMe= {
  introduction: "My name is Simon Gómez, and I was born in 2004 in Santa Marta, Colombia. I began my studies at Bureche School in Santa Marta. However, due to family work-related issues, we moved to Medellín, Colombia, in 2015. I continued my education at San Ignacio School and, upon graduation, applied to the Engineering Management program at EIA University. During my time in the 5th semester, I realized my true passion lay in a different field. This led me to switch my major to Systems Engineering. Currently, I am an aspiring programmer with a strong interest in web development, particularly with React. Though I am just beginning my journey in this field, I have already gained some experience working with Java and Python. My passion for learning and commitment to honing my skills drive me to explore new technologies and best practices continuously. I am eager to grow as a professional, contribute to exciting projects, and connect with others in the tech community. I look forward to learning from and engaging with fellow enthusiasts.",
  background: "I am studyng System Engineering at Universidad EIA.",
  skills: "I have some experience working in data science with the data analytics research group and my experience gained in java doing projects.",
  interests: "I enjoy playing soccer, hanging out with friends or girlfriend, and travelling to new places around Colombia and the world.",
